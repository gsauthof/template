# permissions are important, must be 600

#
# a basic model of the maildrop pattern matching
# (with header-only matching, the default):
#
# - each pattern is matched against the complete header, line by line,
#   captures are taking from the first matching line
# - headers in mime-attachments are matched, as well
# - a to-statement delivers the message and terminates the mailfilter
#   program
